# FILTERS_DESIGNATORS.md

// Filepath: FILTERS_DESIGNATORS.md
// This file documents the official filter designators (possible values) for Assets, Locations, and Users.
// Use this as the single source of truth for filter values and terminology across the app.
//
// - Update this file whenever filter values change in the database or codebase.
// - Reference this file in code reviews and documentation to ensure consistency.
// - Dynamic values (departments, locations) are stored in the database and should be queried as needed.
//
// Reasoning: Created as part of snagging to ensure consistent terminology and reduce data errors.
