* **Icons**: Lucide React (AI for icon integration)

### **Backend**

* **API**: Next.js API routes (AI for defining endpoints and business logic)  
* **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (AI for schema design, query generation, and type inference)  
* **Deployment**: Vercel (AI-aware setup for serverless functions, logging, and PDF generation with browserless.io)

### **Development Practices**

* **Type Safety**: TypeScript (AI for strict typing, error prevention, and refactoring)  
* **Code Quality**: ESLint (AI adherence to linting rules)

## **Slide 6: The AI Development Journey with Cursor IDE**

### **1\. Initial Scaffolding & Setup**

* **Project Initialization**: Cursor IDE assisted in setting up the Next.js project structure, package.json, and initial configurations (tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json).  
* **Environment Setup**: Guided .env.local creation and database connection.

### **2\. Iterative Feature Development**

* **Component Generation**: Rapidly generated UI components (tables, forms, cards) based on descriptions.  
* **API Route Creation**: AI helped define API endpoints for CRUD operations, filtering, and reporting.  
* **Database Interaction**: Assisted in writing Drizzle ORM queries, schema updates, and migration scripts.

### **3\. Debugging & Error Resolution**

* **Contextual Error Analysis**: Cursor IDE provided real-time error detection and suggestions.  
* **Bug Fixes**: Assisted in resolving complex issues like React hook errors, infinite render loops, and type inconsistencies (e.g., CHANGELOG.md entries on filter state and enum usage).

## **Slide 7: The AI Development Journey (Continued)**

### **4\. Refactoring & Code Quality**

* **Type Enforcement**: AI consistently pushed for strict typing and robust type guards across the codebase.  
* **Linter Compliance**: Helped ensure adherence to ESLint rules, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.  
* **Documentation**: Assisted in generating and updating comprehensive README and CHANGELOG files.

### **5\. Learning & Adaptation**
