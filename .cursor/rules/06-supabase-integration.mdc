# Supabase Integration

## Data Access
- Use async/await for all queries.
- Handle errors gracefully; never expose sensitive errors to the client.

## Query Optimization
- Suggest indexes and constraints for performance.
- Use prepared statements and transactions when possible.

## Security
- Never store secrets client-side.
- Validate all input before writing to the database.

## Types
- Use Supabase-generated types for database models.
