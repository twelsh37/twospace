# Testing Strategy

## Frameworks
- Use Jest for unit tests.
- Use React Testing Library for component tests.
- Use Playwright or Cypress for E2E tests.

## Coverage
- Write tests for all components, hooks, and API endpoints.
- Aim for high coverage but prioritize meaningful tests.

## File Placement
- Place tests next to the files they test or in a `__tests__` subfolder.

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., Supabase) in tests.
