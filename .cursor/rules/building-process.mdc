# Building process
- Verify each new feature works by testing it.
- If testing python code use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/index.html#)
- If testing Typescript use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- DO NOT write complicated or confusing code. Opt for the simple and modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, ask the user for guidance.
