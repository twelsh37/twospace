# TailwindCSS Style Guide

## Utility Usage
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all layout, spacing, and color.
- Avoid custom CSS unless necessary.

## Responsive Design
- Design mobile-first.
- Use responsive variants (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) for breakpoints.

## Component Styling
- Use Shadcn UI primitives for consistent design.
- Compose utility classes for clarity and maintainability.

âœ… Good:
<div className="p-4 md:p-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow"> ... </div>
