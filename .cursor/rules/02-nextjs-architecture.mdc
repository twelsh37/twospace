# Next.js Architecture

## File Structure
- Use the `/app` directory for routing and server components.
- Place all client components in `/components` and mark with `"use client"` only when necessary.
- Use lowercase, dash-separated folder names (e.g., `auth-wizard`).

## Component Patterns
- Prefer functional components.
- Use named exports for all components.
- Export main component first, then helpers, then types.

## Data Fetching
- Use server components and server actions for data fetching.
- Use `next-safe-action` for type-safe server actions.
- Avoid client-side fetching unless strictly necessary.

## Error Handling
- Use `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx` for error boundaries.
- Model expected errors as return values, not exceptions.

## Routing
- Use file-based routing; avoid dynamic routes unless required.
