# Documentation standards
When we use typescript we will use docblocks to comment on our code.
Each file will have a full path and file name as its fiirst entry. E.g. // frontend/app/api/assets/ready-to-go-by-type/route.ts

The licence information should be included in every file at the top. Just beneth the filepath and file name
the licence information to display is;

// MIT Licence 
//

// of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

This should then be followed by the File description docblock. 
In this docblock we will have a brief summary of what the file is for. Then a more comprehensive description of the file and its contents.
The file description docblock should have tags for:
@author - This should be set to tom.welsh@theaiaa.com
@version - we should start at version 0.01 and increase this each time the file is modified
@since - This should be written only once and should be written as the file creation date.
@copyright - Copyright 2025 The AIAA Consultants Ltd. All rights reserved
@licence MIT Licence - The licence we distribute the software under

Here is an example of what we would expect
/**
 * Handles all API requests for the application.
 *
 * Provides helper functions for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
 *
 * @file api.ts
 * @version 0.0.1
 * @author Tom Welsh tom.welsh@theaiaa.com
 * @copyright Copyright 2025 The AIAA Consultants Ltd
 * @licence MIT Licence
 * @since 0.0.1
 */
 
 From there on we expect that every function, method, class, interface has a docblock detailing what it dies its parameters and any returns it passes back
