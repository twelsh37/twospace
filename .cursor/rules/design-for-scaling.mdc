# Scaling the solution architecture

When designing an application or service for production that uses an API, it's important to consider how it will scale to meet traffic demands. There are a few key areas we will need to consider regardless of the cloud service provider of our choice:

- Horizontal scaling: You may want to scale our application out horizontally to accommodate requests to our application that come from multiple sources. This could involve deploying additional servers or containers to distribute the load. If we opt for this type of scaling, make sure that the architecture is designed to handle multiple nodes and that we have mechanisms in place to balance the load between them.
- Vertical scaling: Another option is to scale our application vertically, meaning you can beef up the resources available to a single node. This would involve upgrading our server's capabilities to handle the additional load. If we opt for this type of scaling, make sure our application is designed to take advantage of these additional resources.
- Caching: By storing frequently accessed data, we can improve response times without needing to make repeated calls to the API. Our application will need to be designed to use cached data whenever possible and invalidate the cache when new information is added. There are a few different ways we could do this. For example, we could store data in a database, filesystem, or in-memory cache, depending on what makes the most sense for our application.
- Load balancing: Finally, consider load-balancing techniques to ensure requests are distributed evenly across our available servers. This could involve using a load balancer in front of our servers or using DNS round-robin. Balancing the load will help improve performance and reduce bottlenecks.
