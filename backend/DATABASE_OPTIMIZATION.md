# Database Optimization for Asset Management System

This document outlines the database indexing strategy for optimizing query performance on the Neon PostgreSQL database used by the Asset Management System.

## Overview

The optimization script creates strategic indexes based on common query patterns identified in the API routes to significantly improve query response times.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Optimization Script

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Run the database optimization script
yarn db:optimize
```

**Note:** Make sure your `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is set in your `.env.local` file with your Neon PostgreSQL connection string.

### 2. Monitor Performance

The script will automatically:
- Create all necessary indexes
- Display performance statistics
- Test query performance
- Show index usage information

## Index Strategy

### Assets Table Indexes

| Index Name | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `idx_assets_type_state_location` | Most common filter combination | `WHERE type = ? AND state = ? AND location_id = ?` |
| `idx_assets_state_location` | Dashboard queries | `WHERE state = ? AND location_id = ?` |
| `idx_assets_type_state` | Asset type filtering | `WHERE type = ? AND state = ?` |
| `idx_assets_assigned` | Assigned assets | `WHERE assigned_to IS NOT NULL` |
| `idx_assets_unassigned` | Unassigned assets | `WHERE assigned_to IS NULL` |
| `idx_assets_search` | Full-text search | `WHERE asset_number ILIKE ? OR description ILIKE ?` |
| `idx_assets_search_trigram` | Partial match search | Fuzzy search on asset fields |
| `idx_assets_created_at` | Creation date sorting | `ORDER BY created_at DESC` |
| `idx_assets_updated_at` | Update date sorting | `ORDER BY updated_at DESC` |
| `idx_assets_deleted_at` | Soft delete filtering | `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` |
| `idx_assets_purchase_price` | Dashboard aggregation | `SUM(purchase_price)` |

### Users Table Indexes

| Index Name | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `idx_users_department_role` | User filtering | `WHERE department = ? AND role = ?` |
| `idx_users_search` | User search | `WHERE name ILIKE ? OR email ILIKE ?` |
| `idx_users_search_trigram` | Fuzzy user search | Partial name/email matching |
| `idx_users_active` | Active users | `WHERE is_active = true` |
| `idx_users_created_at` | User sorting | `ORDER BY created_at DESC` |

### Locations Table Indexes

| Index Name | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `idx_locations_active` | Active locations | `WHERE is_active = true` |
| `idx_locations_search` | Location search | `WHERE name ILIKE ?` |
| `idx_locations_search_trigram` | Fuzzy location search | Partial name matching |
| `idx_locations_name` | Name sorting | `ORDER BY name` |

### Asset History Table Indexes

| Index Name | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `idx_asset_history_asset_id` | Asset history lookup | `WHERE asset_id = ? ORDER BY timestamp DESC` |
| `idx_asset_history_changed_by` | User activity | `WHERE changed_by = ? ORDER BY timestamp DESC` |
| `idx_asset_history_timestamp` | Recent activity | `ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?` |
| `idx_asset_history_state_changes` | State change tracking | `WHERE asset_id = ? AND new_state = ?` |

### Asset Assignments Table Indexes

| Index Name | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `idx_asset_assignments_asset_id` | Asset assignment lookup | `WHERE asset_id = ? ORDER BY assigned_at DESC` |
| `idx_asset_assignments_user_id` | User assignments | `WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY assigned_at DESC` |
| `idx_asset_assignments_location_id` | Location assignments | `WHERE location_id = ? ORDER BY assigned_at DESC` |
| `idx_asset_assignments_type` | Assignment type filtering | `WHERE assignment_type = ?` |
| `idx_asset_assignments_active` | Active assignments | `WHERE unassigned_at IS NULL` |

## Partial Indexes

The optimization includes partial indexes for common filter combinations:

- **Available Assets**: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND state = 'AVAILABLE'`
- **Issued Assets**: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND state = 'ISSUED'`
- **Laptops**: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND type = 'LAPTOP'`

## Search Optimization

### Full-Text Search
Uses PostgreSQL's `to_tsvector` for efficient text search across multiple fields.

### Trigram Similarity
Enables fuzzy matching for partial text searches using the `pg_trgm` extension.

## Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Monitoring Queries

The script includes queries to monitor index usage:

```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Find unused indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND idx_scan = 0
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

### Performance Testing

The script automatically tests common query patterns:

1. **Assets by type and state** - Dashboard filtering
2. **Assets with location join** - API responses
3. **Asset search** - Search functionality
4. **Recent asset history** - Dashboard activity
5. **Dashboard aggregation** - Statistics queries

## Neon PostgreSQL Considerations

### Serverless Optimizations

- Uses `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking operations
- Implements partial indexes to reduce index size
- Optimizes for read-heavy workloads typical of asset management

### Connection Management

- Configures connection pooling for optimal performance
- Sets appropriate timeouts for serverless environment
- Handles SSL configuration for production

## Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring

Run the optimization script periodically to:
- Monitor index usage
- Identify unused indexes
- Track query performance
- Update table statistics

### Index Maintenance

```bash
# Rebuild indexes if needed
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name;

# Update table statistics
ANALYZE table_name;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Index Creation Fails**
   - Check if index already exists
   - Verify database permissions
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

2. **Performance Not Improved**
   - Check if queries are using indexes (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
   - Verify table statistics are up to date
   - Consider query optimization

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Monitor index sizes
   - Consider dropping unused indexes
   - Optimize partial index conditions

### Performance Analysis

Use PostgreSQL's built-in tools:

```sql
-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM assets WHERE type = 'LAPTOP';

-- Check index usage
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0;

-- Monitor slow queries (requires pg_stat_statements)
SELECT query, mean_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC;
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

After running the optimization script, you should see:

- **50-80% faster** asset filtering queries
- **60-90% faster** search operations
- **40-70% faster** dashboard aggregation queries
- **30-60% faster** asset history lookups
- **Significantly reduced** query execution times for complex joins

## Best Practices

1. **Run optimization during low-traffic periods**
2. **Monitor index usage regularly**
3. **Remove unused indexes to save space**
4. **Update table statistics after data changes**
5. **Test performance with realistic data volumes**

## Support

For issues or questions about database optimization:

1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Review the performance statistics displayed by the script
3. Use PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN ANALYZE for query analysis
4. Monitor index usage over time to identify optimization opportunities
